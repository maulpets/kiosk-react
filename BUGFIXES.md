### 🐛 Bug Fix: Transfer Screen Returning Null Data

**Issue**: Transfer screen was showing "Transfer Not Available" even though `state.user.id` had a valid value. The `kioskData` was returning `null`.

**Root Cause**: The `useKioskStartup` hook was not automatically fetching data because `autoFetch` was set to `false` by default.

**Solution**: Updated the hook call in `src/app/transfer/page.tsx` to include `autoFetch: true`:

```typescript
// Before (not working)
const { data: kioskData, loading, error } = useKioskStartup({ employeeId: state.user?.id });

// After (working)
const { data: kioskData, loading, error } = useKioskStartup({ 
  employeeId: state.user?.id, 
  autoFetch: true 
});
```

**Impact**: This fix ensures that the API call to `/api/kiosk-startup` is automatically triggered when the component mounts and when the `employeeId` is available.

### 🔧 Enhancement: Transfer Operation Data Structure Update

**Changes Made**: Updated the operation data structure to use a discriminated union based on the `operation` number property:

**New Type Structure**:
- `operation: 0` - General operations (view timecard, notes, tips)
- `operation: 1` - Sub-operation operations (punch-in/punch-out)
- `operation: 2` - Transfer operations with specific transfer properties

**Transfer Operation Properties**:
```typescript
interface TransferOperation extends BaseOperation {
  operation: 2;
  transType: number;
  xferStyle: number;
  wgRendering: {
    levels: TransferLevel[];
  };
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/kiosk-startup/route.ts` - Updated mock data structure
- `src/types/kiosk.ts` - Updated TypeScript interfaces
- `src/app/transfer/page.tsx` - Updated to work with new structure
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated operation handling

### 🐛 Bug Fix: TypeScript Interface Mismatch

**Issue**: Transfer screen had TypeScript errors due to missing properties in operation interfaces.

**Solution**: Added missing properties to TypeScript interfaces:

1. **Operation Interface**: Added `transferOptions?: TransferOption[]` property
2. **TransferOption Interface**: Added `icon?`, `nativeAction?`, and `transferRendering?` properties

---

### 🔧 Enhancement: Debug Logging and Data Visualization

**Added Features**:
1. **Console Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for debugging transfer data flow
2. **Debug UI Sections**: Added visual debug sections showing:
   - Complete transfer operation JSON data
   - Current selections as user progresses
   - Final transfer payload that gets sent to native layer

**Code Added**:
```typescript
console.log('State:', JSON.stringify(state));
console.log('User ID:', state.user?.id);
console.log('Kiosk Data:', JSON.stringify(kioskData));
console.log('Loading:', loading);
console.log('Error:', error);
```

### 📝 Development Notes

**Hook Usage Pattern**: When using `useKioskStartup`, always include `autoFetch: true` if you want automatic data loading:

```typescript
const { data: kioskData, loading, error } = useKioskStartup({ 
  employeeId: state.user?.id, 
  autoFetch: true 
});
```

**Transfer Data Flow**:
1. API returns operation with `operation: 2` for transfers
2. Transfer levels are accessed via `transferData.wgRendering.levels`
3. Multi-level selection supports Location (wgLevel: 1) and Position (wgLevel: 4)
4. Final payload includes `transType`, `xferStyle`, and `selections` array

---

### ✅ Verification Steps

1. Navigate to `/transfer` route
2. Check browser console for proper data logging
3. Verify transfer operation data is loaded
4. Test multi-level selection flow (Location → Position)
5. Verify final payload structure on confirmation screen

---

### 🚀 Performance Improvements

**React Hook Optimization**: Used `useMemo` for `transferLevels` to prevent unnecessary re-renders:

```typescript
const transferLevels = useMemo(() => transferData?.wgRendering?.levels || [], [transferData]);
```
